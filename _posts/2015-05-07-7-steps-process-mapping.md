# 7 Steps to Improve Your Process Mapping Skills

You've got your process mapping session with stakeholders scheduled or you might already be on the verge of setting one. 
In either case, a question might revolve in your head, "What should I do to avoid failure once again?" 

If your process maps aren’t turning out the way you expect them to, then it's time for you to understand why. In fact, chances are you don't do it right.

Don’t be offended, though. Everyone needs to refine their skills from time to time, so does a business analyst.
It's easy to fix your problem, once you recognize where it resides. You can easily make corrections and achieve much better results on your new assignment.

Process mapping is very similar to planning your next adventure. You take a map, unfold and then skim it from the start to the end of your journey. 

After having the first impression, you start to look aside your planned path to see what else may be good to take into consideration. 

Finally,  you set your journey stop points and then start exploring the attractions of the selected points to get more details about each of them.
## 1 What should I focus on?

￼Process mapping exercise is about identifying all process attributes:

* Input information and documents
* Tasks within the process in question
* Transformation of inputs into outputs
* Decisions made to support transformation of inputs into outputs 
* Relationships and inter-dependencies with other processes
* Who performs the process and its tasks
* What enabling technology is available.

## 2 What is value of this technique?
The true understanding of the current state keeps you away from costly mistakes in requirements. A good map helps you identify bottlenecks, delays or just pure waste of time and efforts.

The process map serves as a solid basis for developing a solution.

## 3 How Do I Prepare For Process Mapping?
You need to know the following before you start mapping:

* Who DOES the work
* Who provides INPUTS
* Who receives OUTPUTS
* Who MANAGES the process
* What TECHNOLOGY solution(s) is in the use.

## 4 Tips for using the technique

It is important to engage the identified DOERs in the process mapping exercise. Only the people doing the process tasks can give you information that you are after.

When you collaborate with your DOERs, “sell” the purpose of the exercise – make their job smarter instead of keeping it hard.

Don’t be afraid to ask about “obvious” things that your DOER just takes for granted.

Keep your eye on the most painful aspects of the mentioned tasks, make notes about possible causes of the pain points.
Don’t map everything mentioned by the DOERs. Only map the process that you’ve chosen to map.

## 5 Why should I care about interfaces?
The interfaces between the processes are important for a design of the solution. Try to capture 

* handshake points
* who owns the process/tasks **before** and **after** the handshake point.

You also need to know when the process output that crossed the organisation’s ‘boundary” will be received back as a new input into the process to enable its full completion. Timing is important here!

## 6 What Questions Should I Ask?
There are quite a few questions that you need to have ready:

* If there is a pain point, why are we still doing that task?
* What is impact of not doing this task?
* What change could reduce or cut the pain point?
* If the task/process changes, what are new conditions for doing the job:
    * steps
    * governing rules
    * enabling technology - training (new skills)
* what are acceptance criteria for the changes?

## 7 What Are Key Outputs of The Process Mapping?
After drafting and examining the mapped process, you can specify the following:

* Current state of the process
* Involved DOERs
* All tasks within the process
* Process interfaces/exchange points
* Key pain points (rework, delays, waste etc) q Impact of pain points
* Potential changes helping to cure the pain points 
* Change acceptance criteria.

## What’s Next?
Plan your next process mapping exercise using the information and tips given above. Practice to ask questions and keep your scope tight. Use the handy tool I’ve added below (the picture has to be embedded).
