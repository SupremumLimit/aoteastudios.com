# A Navigator to Business Analysis

Whether you are just starting out or already have years of experience in the business analysis field, completing BA tasks successfully project after project is a difficult job. 

*Am I following best practices? Have I covered everything to make this project a success? How can I avoid getting bogged down by my tasks?* I'm sure you've asked yourself dozens of questions like these. 

But with looming deadlines, legacy systems, undocumented processes, busy and distracted stakeholders, it's hard to find time to work on your skills. It's especially true when your options consist of long books with an academic bent, and expensive training courses.

Judging by my own experience across many projects, the profession has a rather tall learning curve, even for experienced people, not to mention those who are just starting out in the job. It requires a lot of practice with approach and techniques. You need to learn many tricks to do the job effectively and build your professional value.

### What if there was an easier way to boost your skills?

Imagine if there was a business analysis book which was laser-focused on giving you <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">practical advice</span> and tons of <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">tips</span>, making it easy to understand and absorb complex concepts quickly.

## A Navigator to Business Analysis

I have condensed decades of practical experience, a dozen books, and countless articles into just one ebook. You can learn quickly with this book.

_A Navigator to Business Analysis_ is a book full of useful tips on communication with business users, obtaining information by observing users' activities, documenting the results of analysis, getting your point across with visual aids, and more.

It is a new and expanded book which builds on the solid foundation of our previous business analysis guide, _BA Kickstart_. Here is what people had to say about it:

> **I loved Kickstart for its concise visual breakdown of the typical BA processes. I am definitely a multi-channel, visual learner and can only consume so much BABOK text before the message gets lost.** <br/><br/> **Your diagrams really highlight the power of synthesizing information down into a visual model that represents multiple levels of information (system components, workflow, milestones, participants, context etc).** <br/><br/>- *Ed Garabedian, Business Analyst, Johnson & Wales University, USA*

> <strong>As a senior business analyst, I loved it, as it is a perfect reference manual and a great refresher. I intend to hold on to this document for a long time to come! <br/><br/> I read the document in one go yesterday and at the end of the day felt successful, as you and Sergey were able to refresh my knowledge.</strong> <br/><br/>- *Jehangir Rizvi, Senior Business Analyst, Australian & New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australia*

> **Yes it is excellent!!! I am a visual learner and your start kit will make it easier for me.** - *Sheela Patel, Business Analyst, USA*

> **Wonderful! I downloaded it and it has the high-quality graphics I was expecting! You guys do excellent work! Thanks very much for your excellent customer service as well!** <br/><br/>- *Mark DeVries, USA*

_A Navigator to Business Analysis_ follows the same successful approach: 

* delivers a lot of information through quality visuals
* enables you learn at your own pace
* facilitates quick grasping of new complex knowledge
* saves you time on learning professional tricks 
* delivers new effective skills
* gives you great insights into BA techniques
* delivers faster results that can be used in your job straight away.

Part 1 will particularly suit those readers who are considering business analysis as a potential profession, or those making initial steps in a BA career. 

## More than just business analysis...

To be successful as a BA, you need to understand <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">more than just analysis</span>, and that's why Part 2 of the book is dedicated to things which aren't part of the business analysis but are nonetheless essential for a BA to understand:

In these sections, I give you carefully extracted knowledge about all these areas which is relevant to business analysts. How many books would you have to read to find it all out yourself? Save you all that time and expense!

## BONUS Part 3: Building up your value

The first two parts of the book will provide you with a wealth of knowledge, but I didn't feel that I was quite done after completing them. So I added in a bonus Part 3. 

When you read an ad about a business analyst position, you see that certain domain knowledge, and hard and soft skills are required from a candidate. A unique blend of your skills and experience is what makes your CV noticeable in a pile of other CVs.

How can you create that unique blend? What are the key components? Part 3 of the book is focused on answering these questions. Here is the table of contents for it:

    Values System ... 343
    Focus on Growth ... 344
    Negotiation ... 347
    Resilience ... 351
    Leadership ... 357
    Learning Business Domain ... 361
    Failures – Lessons Learned ... 366
    Keeping Up To Date ... 369
    Building Productive Relationships ... 371
    Managing Communications ... 372
    Behavioral Models ... 374
    Engaging Stakeholders ... 380
    e-Leadership ... 383
    Requirements: Discovery Patterns ... 387
    Requirements: Patterns ... 393
    Poor Requirements: Impact ... 398
    Change Management ... 401
    Risk Management ... 403
    Issues Management ... 405
    Universal Functional Business Model ... 407
    User Experience ... 409
    Customer Experience Mapping ... 413
    Analysis Patterns: Big Data ... 419

Mastering these techniques will help you produce better results and provide more value to your employer.
