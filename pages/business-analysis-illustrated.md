# Business Analysis Illustrated

We've taken a tall stack of books, heaps of articles, and a large helping of practical experience and converted them into neat diagrams, because we know you're busy and have enough reading to do as it is!

Here are several samples of our free charts which have been praised by hundreds of people:

## What you get:

This chart collection is designed for business analysts, and because a great business analyst understands more than just business analysis, it covers a range of subjects. You'll find <span style = "background-color: #fff77c">15 unique charts</span> in the pack:

*   **Stakeholder engagement**
